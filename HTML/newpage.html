    <h1>New York</h1>
    <br>
    <p>New York, not to be confused with the city of New York. New York was one of the original 13 colonies to be turned into a state of the US. It’s home to some of the most iconic and famous buildings, people, and institutions in the world. So today, let’s dive into what makes New York state so exceptional. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>American revolution</h3>
    <p>New York was the place where many significant historical events took place, such as  the writing of the constitution, and a large part of the American Revolution, of newer events 9/11. The popular musical Hamilton, albeit not completely accurate, takes place almost entirely in New York. Goes to show just how significant of a place New York is for America.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Places and buildings</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>The Empire State Building</h3>
    <p>Formerly the tallest building between 1931 and 1954, and currently 46’th tallest in the world, the Empire State building is a skyscraper, iconic to the infrastructure of New York. It stands at a whopping 449 meters and was built in about 1 year and 1 month, which was and still is incredibly fast for a building of this magnitude. It first became famous for being the tallest building in the world, but it still holds onto it’s notoriety today. Not just for it’s height but also for appearing in famous films such as King Kong, it’s Art-Deco design, and it’s unavoidable presence in the New York skyline.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Statue of Liberty</h3>
    <p>The Statue of Liberty is another iconic monument of New York and honestly, of the entire USA. The Statue of Liberty was originally gifted to the USA by the French. It is supposed to represent freedom and- naturally- liberty. In her right hand she is holding a torch, to represent the freedom that is supposed to light up the world and in her left hand she is holding a tablet with the date July 4’th 1776 engraved onto it, the date of the 
    emancipation- liberation - of the USA.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Motto& Flower& Bird</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Ever Upward!</h3>
    <p>The official motto of New York is "Excelsior". “Excelsior” is latin for “Ever upward”. This is supposed to represent and inspire eternal growth and progress.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa~</h3>
    <p>The official flower of New York is the rose, and was officially named the state flower in 1955.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Is it a plane?</h3>
    <p>The state bird of New York is the Eastern Bluebird. This bird is- mostly blue!</p>

    <h3> Capital of New York (Which is not New York City)</h3>
    <p>Was it not enough to find out as a kid that New York City is not the capital of the US? Moreso, it is not even the capital of New York state… this title goes to Albany, and not for nothing. Albany's history is rich and complicated, and the city is shaped by a complex set of factors. Placed over the Hudson river, which was and is still a pivotal part of trade routes, it got the title of the capitol in 1797. Albany is built on the terrain that was before colonisation inhabited by Mohawks and Mohicans.</p>

    <p>The then European influence started by an Englishman working for Dutch, Henry Hudson. It was him who claimed it for the Dutch, and you can still experience the dutch roots of the place, by attending one of many pubs as old as 300 years, or witnessing the Tulip Festival in May. The history of the city is absolutely fascinating and cannot be contained in a short essay by any means. It is certainly worth exploring, and what a better way to do it than to visit this vibrant, mysterious and fascinating place. Many consider its architecture to be the most beautiful in the US, stretching for good 300 years and enclosing many historical and modern styles.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>New York City</h3>
    <p>New York city is- as we’ve just established- not the capital of New York. Despite this though it is still an iconic place and has amassed a lot of fame over the years. New York City, or NYC, is the most populated city in the USA, and contains five boroughs. Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Brooklyn.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Nine-Nine!</h3>
    <p>Brooklyn! Brooklyn is where my favorite- and objectively the best ever- TV-show takes place! Brooklyn 99! There’s also a bridge called “The Brooklyn Bridge”, and it’s a significant landmark of Brooklyn, but who cares about that! Brooklyn 99 is an 8 season long sit-com starring Andy Samberg as the main character Jake Peralta- Huh? Sorry? I’m going off topic and already approaching the word limit for this text? Oh… Okay.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Hercules, of The Bronx</h3>
    <p>No, not that Hercules, let me explain. Though The Bronx is technically a lower class area more prone to poverty and crime, that does not mean you should be quick to dismiss it. Through the blackouts and looting, the poverty, adversity, and violence, came the start of a whole new genre- nay, culture. The Bronx is the birthplace of Hip-Hop. Hence the name Hercules mentioned at the start of this text. Not the Greek mythology figure, but the man considered to be one of the founders of Hip-Hop, and happens to be nicknamed after The Hercules, because he was also quite strong and athletic. A place such as the Bronx is probably one of the only places Hip-Hop could ever be born, since the roots of Hip-Hop are in lyrical poetry about the harsh reality of living in a place riddled with poverty and struggle, just like The Bronx.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>It’s… definitely a place.</h3>
    <p>Staten Island is… not very popular! It’s rarely talked about and not very well-liked, but it’s not like it’s completely empty! I mean it… it kind of is empty, in the sense that it is the least populated borough of New York. Staten Island is also the most suburban borough of New York, for whatever that’s worth.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Home of Times Square</h3>
    <p>Possibly the most well known borough is Manhattan. It contains some iconic tourist spots such as Times Square and Central Park, as well as being the location of famous and infamous events such as New York fashion week and 9/11.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Queens</h3>
    <p>I didn’t come up with some weird reference to allude to the name of the borough for the title of this paragraph because I simply adore the name Queens! Queens is the largest by area of all five boroughs. There’s also a popular statue in Queens, the Unisphere, so that’s interesting, if nothing else.</p>
